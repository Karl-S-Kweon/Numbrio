# **React App  - Numbrio **
##### This is a recreation of 'Bulls and Cows' or 'Number Baseball' game. <br/> Unlike the classic rules, this game displays visible results of each guess, as its UI/UX inspired by Wordle. <br/> This will be enjoyable for all ages after 5y. 

## ** Environments **
##### This app is currently developed by the front-end side only.
##### But this is still under deveopment. So, Upcoming updates will include some game features as well as expansion of app environments.
##### <s>[Gmae Features]</s>: Hard Mode, Dark Theme, Player Statistics, Play Result Sharing, ... <br/>[App Environments]: Add Back-End Side with simple RESTful services. Then the game algorithm will communicate with server side to get results.
##### The server side stack will vary; Express.js, Java Spring, C# Dot Net, or new tech that I have not experienced. <br/> DB side will may be considered (for the fullstack practice, if possible) when all ohter updates are done. <br/> Design and UX enhancement through code restructuring and CSS preprocessor (SCSS).

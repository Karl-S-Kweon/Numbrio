# React App  - Numbrio
#### This is a recreation of 'Bulls and Cows' or 'Number Baseball' game. <br/> Unlike the classic rules, this game displays visible results of each guess, as its UI/UX inspired by Wordle. <br/> This will be enjoyable for all ages after 5y.
<br/>

## Environments
#### This app is currently developed by the front-end side only. <br/> However, this is still under development. Upcoming updates will may include Back-End Side.
<br/>

## Assignments
#### The purpose of the project was to review my web skills. <br/> The result seems very nice, but I still want to scale up this proejct. 
#### 1. Use Redux and SCSS - Refactoring app structures & code to improve Design, UX, and App Lifecycle <br/> 2. Add Back-End Side - The game algorithm will communicate with a server using Restful Service(s).<br/> 3. More powerful Game Realted Features - Hard Mode, Play Stats and more. <br/> 4. DB side will may be considered (to make this a fullstack app) when all ohter updates are done.
<br/>

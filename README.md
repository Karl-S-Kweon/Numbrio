# React App  - Numbrio 
##### This is a recreation of 'Bulls and Cows' or 'Number Baseball' game. <br/> Unlike the classic rules, this game displays visible results of each guess, as its UI/UX inspired by Wordle. <br/> This will be enjoyable for all ages after 5y. 

## Environments
##### This app is currently developed by the front-end side only. <br/> So, you only need to configure front-end environment powered by React using ```npm install```.  <br/> After installation, run the project with ```npm run dev```. The server will run on ```localhost:3000``` (windows).

##### But this is still under deveopment. So, Upcoming updates will include some game features as well as expansion of app environments.
##### [Gmae Features]: Hard Mode, Dark Theme, Player Statistics, Play Result Sharing, ... <br/>[App Environments]: Add Back-End Side with simple RESTful services. Then the game algorithm will communicate with server side to get results.
##### The server side stack will vary; Express.js, Java Spring, C# Dot Net, or new tech that I have not experienced. <br/> DB side will may be considered (for the fullstack practice, if possible) when all ohter updates are done. <br/> Design and UX enhancement through code restructuring and adding up SCSS.

### Front-End Installations

#### * Material UI

### Back-ENd Installations
